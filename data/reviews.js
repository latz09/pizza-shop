        review: 'Easily the best Pizza in the twin cities, I drive from Burnsville (18 miles each way) to get their pizza and it is worth the drive.  Thanks to the owner and the staff for making such a delicious pizza with outstanding toppings and the best sausage I have ever had on a pizza. I have been to Italy and the Pizza Shop is better.',
